📍A web framework is a software tool that helps developers build web applications efficiently. It provides structure, reusable components, and handles common tasks like routing, templating, and database access.

📍Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript code outside the browser—usually on servers. It’s built on Chrome’s V8 engine and is great for building scalable, fast web apps and APIs.


📍Express.js is a minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js. It helps you build APIs and web servers quickly by handling routing, middleware, and HTTP requests.


⭐An opinionated framework makes strong decisions about how your app should be structured. It provides built-in conventions, tools, and patterns—so you don’t have to decide everything yourself.

⭐An unopinionated framework gives you the freedom to structure your app however you want. It provides minimal guidance and lets you choose your own tools, patterns, and architecture.
